    <p>Wezla the Inventor was a joint effort between me and an artist friend during my latter two years in Highschool. Written in Lua, Wezla was my first attempt at a moderately sized game modification project. The mod consists of the eponymous character, Wezla, and an array of unique tools he could craft to surive the harsh landscape of the game. The art is all original, and was animated by myself using a progam known as Spriter. And despite being now grossly outdated, it has notheless garnered over 10,000 unique downloads on Steam's Workshop.
